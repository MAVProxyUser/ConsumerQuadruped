So you want to get a robot dog!? I did too, so I stopped talking about it, and made it happen.

But why? 
[Ask Hackaday: What good is a robot dog?](https://hackaday.com/2019/09/25/ask-hackaday-what-good-is-a-robot-dog/#more-377998)


I remember seeing [Big Dog](https://www.bostondynamics.com/legacy), "The first legged robot to leave the lab" on [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2011/09/30/new-bigdog-video-doesnt-fail-to-impress/
). I always had high hopes that one day the technology would be smaller, or at least more affordable. That day is here for the most part, however the "affordable" part is of course still a bit subjective.

[![BigDOg](http://img.youtube.com/vi/xqMVg5ixhd0/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqMVg5ixhd0) 

Although "affordable", and Boston Dynamics generally don't belong in the same sentence, Boston Dynamics has of course been a very critical part of bringing these quadruped technology advances to light the entire time. [Evolution of Boston Dynamic’s Robots(1992-2022)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rdm2ggtFvmQ).

As impressive as all the Boston Dynamics robots are, I personally only payed attention to a few milestones. Cheetah was the first concept that really caught my eye. The press at that time was claiming it could move faster than [Usain Bolt](https://web.archive.org/web/20120906124029/https://www.darpa.mil/NewsEvents/Releases/2012/09/05.aspx). 

[![Cheetah](https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/dangerroom/2011/02/cheetah.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chPanW0QWhA)

Similarly Cheetah's cousin WildCat from Boston Dynamics brought new found speeds to unleashed, outdoor quadrupeds.

DARPA helped both the Boston Dynamics, and MIT quadruped "Cheetah" programs gain legs metaphorically speaking. The [Maximum Mobility and Manipulation (M3)](https://www.darpa.mil/program/maximum-mobility-and-manipulation) and [Machine Common Sense (MCS) programs](https://www.darpa.mil/program/machine-common-sense) directly funded both efforts.

In a paper titled "[Design principles for highly efficient quadrupeds and implementation on the MIT Cheetah robot](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6631038)" the design features for MIT Cheetah hardware were "presented", "as an embodiment" of the principles within the paper itself. At that time the MIT Cheetah was ["the second fastest legged robot in the world"](https://spectrum.ieee.org/mit-cheetah-robot-running), of course, second to Boston Dynamics Cheetah.

Early versions of MIT Cheetah were still well with in the class I would consider inaccessable, and were very much academic. 

Cheetah 1

From this snapshot in time forward however, things started becoming more "accessible"!

Once the dogs were open sourced... [China latched on](https://hackaday.com/2019/10/19/mit-mini-cheetah-made-and-improved-in-china/
), instantly bringing options to Alibaba.

At some point the nomenclature bounced back and forth between dogs, and big cats.. they seem to be fairly interchangable, however "dog" seems to be taking precedence. 

To come full circle on the subjective "affordable" dogs, meet [MJbots quad](https://hackaday.io/project/167845-mjbots-quad): An open-source, affordable, dynamic quadruped robot 

["The mjbots quad is a small dynamic quadruped, like the MIT mini-Cheetah, but fully open source licensed under the Apache 2.0 license."](https://hackaday.com/2019/10/03/amazing-open-source-quadruped-capable-of-dynamic-motion/)

So which pooch did I get? Well I couldn't decide, so I got two! I'll probably buy a third soon. Oh, and a robotic arm! The first two I'm importing are the [Xiaomi Cyberdog](https://xiaomi-mi.com/appliances/yi-home-camera-3/), and the [Unitree Go1](https://www.unitree.com/products/go1/).

The third pooch I seek to obtain is the [DeepRobotics Jueying Lite2](https://www.deeprobotics.cn/en/products_jy_476.html). These 3 dogs seem to be cornering the market for the moment in the "affordable" range.

Ghost Robotics [Vision 60](https://www.ghostrobotics.io/vision-60), and Boston [Spot](https://www.bostondynamics.com/products/spot) being the next logical choices for many situations.
